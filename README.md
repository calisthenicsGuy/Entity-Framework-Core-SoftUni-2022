# Entity-Framework-Core-SoftUni-2022

The course "Entity Framework Core" follows in detail the work with the ORM technology: Entity Framework Core (EF core), which is a standard for ORM in C# and .NET Core applications. EF Core enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model through "database first" and "code first" approaches, and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations. EF core provides both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process the data from the database. In the course, we will demonstrate proven practices in building the database layer of complex systems in C# applications through built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and the use of the service layer (Service Layer), as well as import and export to different data formats (JSON, XML).
